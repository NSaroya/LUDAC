# LUDAC

## For the EE 2023/24 Capstone Group (22):
If you are pushing to this repository take sure your code is well-commented, it would not be overkill to comment nearly every single line. Use descriptive variable names. We are following a feature branch workflow (instructions are detailed in the Google Drive).

### Header Files
Keep as many global variables, typedef, etc. in header files. There is a ludac_esp.h file to start with, for LoRa related things make a ludac_lora.h file, make one for GPS etc.

### Main Program Loop
Function prototypes go at top, function definitions go at the bottom, the main loop and initialization go in the middle.
